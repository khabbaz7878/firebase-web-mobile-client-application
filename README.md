<h1>Firebase-web-mobile-client-application</h1>
<p>This diagram represents the architecture of a Firebase web/mobile client application. It is connected to various Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services and infrastructure components. Here's a breakdown of the diagram:

*Firebase web/mobile client: This is the client-side application that interacts with the Firebase services.

*Internet: This represents the internet connection that the client application uses to communicate with the Firebase services.

*Firebase Auth/Identity Platform (global): This is the Firebase service that manages user authentication and identity. It is globally available.

*Cloud Armor (global): This is a GCP service that provides security for HTTP(S) load balancers. It is globally available.

*Cloud Storage (multi-region): This is a GCP service that provides scalable and durable object storage. It is available in multiple regions.

*HTTP Load Balancer (global): This is a GCP service that distributes incoming requests across multiple backend instances. It is globally available.

*Firebase Hosting (global): This is the Firebase service that hosts and serves web applications. It is globally available.

*Firebase Projects: This represents the Firebase projects that contain the Firebase services.

*Cloud Logging (global): This is a GCP service that allows you to store, search, and analyze log data. It is globally available.

*Google Cloud Platform: This represents the Google Cloud Platform that hosts the Firebase services and infrastructure components.

*Firestore: This is the Firebase service that provides a NoSQL database for storing and syncing data.

*Firestore Cluster: This represents the Firestore cluster that stores the data.

*Firebase Cloud Functions: This is the Firebase service that allows you to run serverless functions in response to events.

*Cloud Monitoring (global): This is a GCP service that provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. It is globally available.

*northamerica-northeast 1 (Montreal): This represents the Google Cloud region where the Firestore cluster is located.

*Apigee Edge: This is a GCP service that provides API management, development, and security.


*CN Hub Project: This represents the GCP project that contains the Firestore cluster.

*Serverless VPC Access Connector (region 1): This is a GCP service that allows you to connect serverless applications to VPC networks. It is available in multiple regions.


*Serverless VPC Access Connector (region 2): This represents the Serverless VPC Access Connector in another region.

*us-central1 (lowa): This represents the Google Cloud region where the VPC Access Connector is located.

*VPC FW (global): This is a GCP service that provides firewall rules for VPC networks. It is globally available.

*us-central2 (Oklahoma-private GCP region): This represents the Google Cloud region where the VPC Access Connector is located.


The lines connecting the shapes represent the connections between the client application and the various Firebase services and GCP infrastructure components..</p>
